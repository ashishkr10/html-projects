                <h1 class="primary">INDIA</h1>
                <p>India (Hindi: Bhārat), officially the Republic of India (Hindi: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),is a country
                    in South Asia. It is the second-most populous country, the seventh-largest country by land area, and
                    the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea
                    on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to
                    the northwest; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east.
                    In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar
                    Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar and Indonesia. <br>
                    India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed in a democratic parliamentary system. It is a
                    pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951
                    to 1.211 billion in 2011.During the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from
                    US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively
                    destitute country in 1951,[51] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for
                    information technology services, with an expanding middle class.It has a space programme which
                    includes several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual
                    teachings play an increasing role in global culture.India has substantially reduced its rate of
                    poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.India is a nuclear-weapon state,
                    which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan
                    and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.Among the socio-economic challenges India
                    faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,and rising levels of air pollution.[57] India's
                    land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.Its forest cover comprises 21.4% of its
                    area.India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's
                    culture,is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.</p>

                    <h2 class="secondary">HISTORY</h2>
                    <p>By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent
                        from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.The earliest known modern human remains in
                        South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food
                        crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus
                        appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in what is now Balochistan, Pakistan.These gradually
                        developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,the first urban culture in South Asia,
                        which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in what is now Pakistan and western India.Centred around
                        cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of
                        subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.</p>

                        <h2 class="secondary">MODERN</h2>
                        <p>Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885. The appointment
                            in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the stage for changes
                            essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of sovereignty, the
                            surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens. Technological changes—among them,
                            railways, canals, and the telegraph—were introduced not long after their introduction in
                            Europe.However, disaffection with the company also grew during this time and
                            set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments and perceptions, including invasive
                            British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of some rich landowners and
                            princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the foundations
                            of Company rule.Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution
                            of the East India Company and the direct administration of India by the British government.
                            Proclaiming a unitary state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new
                    rulers also protected princes and landed gentry as a feudal safeguard against future
                    unrest.In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India, leading
                    eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.</p>

                    <p>India accounts for the bulk of the Indian subcontinent, lying atop the Indian tectonic plate, a part
                        of the Indo-Australian Plate.India's defining geological processes began 75 million years ago
                        when the Indian Plate, then part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, began a north-eastward
                        drift caused by seafloor spreading to its south-west, and later, south and south-east.
                        Simultaneously, the vast Tethyan oceanic crust, to its northeast, began to subduct under the
                        Eurasian Plate.These dual processes, driven by convection in the Earth's mantle, both created
                        the Indian Ocean and caused the Indian continental crust eventually to under-thrust Eurasia and to
                        uplift the Himalayas.Immediately south of the emerging Himalayas, plate movement created a
                        vast trough that rapidly filled with river-borne sediment and now constitutes the Indo-Gangetic
                        Plain.Cut off from the plain by the ancient Aravalli Range lies the Thar Desert.</p>

                        <p>India is a megadiverse country, a term employed for 17 countries which display high biological
                            diversity and contain many species exclusively indigenous, or endemic, to them.[184] India is a
                            habitat for 8.6% of all mammal species, 13.7% of bird species, 7.9% of reptile species, 6% of
                            amphibian species, 12.2% of fish species, and 6.0% of all flowering plant species.[185][186] Fully a
                            third of Indian plant species are endemic.[187] India also contains four of the world's 34
                            biodiversity hotspots,[59] or regions that display significant habitat loss in the presence of high
                            endemism.</p>

                            <p>India is the world's most populous democracy.A parliamentary republic with a multi-party
                                system,it has eight recognised national parties, including the Indian National Congress and
                                the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and more than 40 regional parties.The Congress is considered
                                centre-left in Indian political culture,and the BJP right-wing.For most of the
                                period between 1950—when India first became a republic—and the late 1980s, the Congress held a
                                majority in the parliament. Since then, however, it has increasingly shared the political stage with
                                the BJP,as well as with powerful regional parties which have often forced the creation of
                                multi-party coalition governments at the centre.</p>

                <h2 class="secondary">ECONOMY</h2>
                <p>According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Indian economy in 2019 was nominally worth
                    $2.9 trillion; it is the fifth-largest economy by market exchange rates, and is around $11 trillion,
                    the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP).With its average annual GDP growth rate of
                    5.8% over the past two decades, and reaching 6.1% during 2011–2012,India is one of the world's
                    fastest-growing economies.However, the country ranks 139th in the world in nominal GDP per
                    capita and 118th in GDP per capita at PPP.Until 1991, all Indian governments followed
                    protectionist policies that were influenced by socialist economics. Widespread state intervention
                    and regulation largely walled the economy off from the outside world. An acute balance of payments
                    crisis in 1991 forced the nation to liberalise its economy;since then it has moved slowly
                    towards a free-market system[292][293] by emphasising both foreign trade and direct investment
                    inflows.India has been a member of WTO since 1 January 1995.</p>

                    <p>In the 2011 census, about 73% of the population was literate, with 81% for men and 65% for women.
                        This compares to 1981 when the respective rates were 41%, 53% and 29%. In 1951 the rates were 18%,
                        27% and 9%. In 1921 the rates 7%, 12% and 2%. In 1891 they were 5%, 9% and 1%, According
                        to Latika Chaudhary, in 1911 there were under three primary schools for every ten villages.
                        Statistically, more caste and religious diversity reduced private spending. Primary schools taught
                        literacy, so local diversity limited its growth.,<br>
                        
                        Education system of India is the world's second largest higher education System.India had over

                        system, a significant number of seats are reserved under affirmative action policies for the
                        historically disadvantaged. In recent decades India's improved education system is often cited as
                        one of the main contributors to its economic development</p>
