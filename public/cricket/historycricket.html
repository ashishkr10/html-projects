            <p>
                  Cricket is believed to have begun possibly as early as the 13th century as a game in which country
                  boys bowled at a tree stump or at the hurdle gate into a sheep pen. This gate consisted of two
                  uprights and a crossbar resting on the slotted tops; the crossbar was called a bail and the entire
                  gate a wicket. The fact that the bail could be dislodged when the wicket was struck made this
                  preferable to the stump, which name was later applied to the hurdle uprights. Early manuscripts differ
                  about the size of the wicket, which acquired a third stump in the 1770s, but by 1706 the pitch—the
                  area between the wickets—was 22 yards long. <br> <br>
                  The ball, once presumably a stone, has remained much the same since the 17th century. Its modern
                  weight of between 5.5 and 5.75 ounces (156 and 163 grams) was established in 1774. <br> <br>
                  The primitive bat was no doubt a shaped branch of a tree, resembling a modern hockey stick but
                  considerably longer and heavier. The change to a straight bat was made to defend against length
                  bowling, which had evolved with cricketers in Hambledon, a small village in southern England. The bat
                  was shortened in the handle and straightened and broadened in the blade, which led to forward play,
                  driving, and cutting. As bowling technique was not very advanced during this period, batting dominated
                  bowling through the 18th century. <br> <br>

            <h3> The early years </h3>
      </div>

      <div class="level2">
            <p>
                  The earliest reference to an 11-a-side match, played in Sussex for a stake of 50 guineas, dates from
                  1697. In 1709 Kent met Surrey in the first recorded intercounty match at Dartford, and it is probable
                  that about this time a code of laws (rules) existed for the conduct of the game, although the earliest
                  known version of such rules is dated 1744. Sources suggest that cricket was limited to the southern
                  counties of England during the early 18th century, but its popularity grew and eventually spread to
                  London, notably to the Artillery Ground, Finsbury, which saw a famous match between Kent and
                  All-England in 1744. Heavy betting and disorderly crowds were common at matches. <br> <br>
                  The aforementioned Hambledon Club, playing in Hampshire on Broadhalfpenny Down, was the predominant
                  cricket force in the second half of the 18th century before the rise of the Marylebone Cricket Club
                  (MCC) in London. Formed from a cricket club that played at White Conduit Fields, the club moved to
                  Lord’s Cricket Ground in St. Marylebone borough in 1787 and became the MCC and in the following year
                  published its first revised code of laws. Lord’s, which was named after its founder, Thomas Lord, has
                  had three locations over its history. Moving to the current ground in St. John’s Wood in 1814, Lord’s
                  became the headquarters of world cricket. <br> <br>
                  In 1836 the first match of North counties versus South counties was played, providing clear evidence
                  of the spread of cricket. In 1846 the All-England XI, founded by William Clarke of Nottingham, began
                  touring the country, and from 1852, when some of the leading professionals (including John Wisden, who
                  later compiled the first of the famous Wisden almanacs on cricketing) seceded to form the United
                  All-England XI, these two teams monopolized the best cricket talent until the rise of county cricket.
                  They supplied the players for the first English touring team overseas in 1859. <br> <br>

            <h3> Technical development </h3>
      </div>

      <div class="level2">
            <p>
                  Until early in the 19th century all bowling was underhand, and most bowlers favoured the high-tossed
                  lob. Next came “the round-arm revolution,” in which many bowlers began raising the point at which they
                  released the ball. Controversy raged furiously, and in 1835 the MCC rephrased the law to allow the
                  hand to be raised as high as the shoulder. The new style led to a great increase in pace, or bowling
                  speed. Gradually bowlers raised the hand higher and higher in defiance of the law. Matters were
                  brought to a head in 1862 when an England team playing against Surrey left the field at London’s
                  Kennington Oval in protest over a “no ball” call (i.e., an umpire’s decision that the bowler has
                  thrown an illegal pitch). The argument centred on whether the bowler should be allowed to raise his
                  arm above the shoulder. As a result of this controversy, the bowler was in 1864 officially accorded
                  liberty to bowl overhand (but not to cock and straighten the arm). This change dramatically altered
                  the game, making it yet more difficult for a batsman to judge the ball. Already a bowler was allowed
                  to take a running start from any direction and for any distance. Once the bowler was allowed to
                  release overhand, the ball could then reach speeds above 90 mph (145 km/hr). Though this is not as
                  fast as the pitching speed in baseball, cricket has an additional twist in that the ball is usually
                  delivered so as to bounce on the pitch (field) before the batsman can hit it. Thus, the ball may curve
                  to the right or the left, bounce low or high, or spin toward or away from the batsman. <br> <br>
                  Batsmen learned to protect themselves with pads and batting gloves, and a cane handle increased the
                  resilience of the bat. Only the best batsmen, however, could cope with fast bowling, because the poor
                  condition of most pitches made it yet more difficult for a batsman to predict the motion of the ball.
                  As the grounds improved, however, batsmen grew accustomed to the new bowling style and went on the
                  offensive. Other new bowling styles were also discovered, causing batsmen to adjust their technique
                  further. <br> <br>
                  In the early 20th century so many runs were being scored that debate ensued on reforming the
                  “leg-before-wicket” law, which had been introduced in the 1774 laws to prohibit a batsman from using
                  his body to prevent the ball from hitting his wicket. But the heavy scores were actually due to the
                  performances of several outstanding batsmen, such as W.G. Grace, Sir John Berry Hobbs, and K.S.
                  Ranjitsinhji (later the maharaja of Nawanagar). This was cricket’s golden age. <br> <br>
                  In the 20th century there was a series of attempts to aid the bowler and quicken the tempo of the
                  game. Nevertheless, the game by the mid-20th century was characterized not by overwhelming offense but
                  by defensive play on both sides and by a slow pace. In an attempt to shore up a declining fan base,
                  one-day, or limited-overs, cricket was introduced. One-day cricket had first been played
                  internationally when, after a Test match was rained out for the first days, on the last scheduled day
                  of play a limited-overs match was held in order to give the fans some game to watch. The response was
                  enthusiastic, and one-day cricket came into being. In this version of cricket the limited number of
                  overs (usually 50 per side) leads to a faster paced though much-altered game. In one-day cricket there
                  are some restrictions on placement of fielders. This led to new batting styles, such as the paddle
                  shot (wherein the ball is hit behind the wicket because there are usually no fielders there) and the
                  lofted shot (where the batsman tries to hit the ball past the fielders and over their heads). Twenty20
                  (T20), a style of one-day cricket consisting of 20 overs per side, debuted in 2003 and quickly became
                  an international sensation. The first Twenty20 world championship was held in 2007, and one-day
                  cricket, particularly Twenty20, became more popular than Test matches worldwide, although Test cricket
                  retained a large following in England. The pace of Test matches increased dramatically in the late
                  20th century with the introduction of new bowling strategies. <br> <br>

            <h3> International cricket </h3>
      </div>

      <div class="level2">
            <p>
                  International cricket in the early part of the 20th century was dominated by the original members of
                  the Imperial Cricket Conference, England, Australia, and South Africa. Later renamed the International
                  Cricket Conference and then the International Cricket Council, the ICC gradually took over more
                  responsibility for the administration of the game and shifted its power base from west to east. When
                  in 2005 the ICC moved its offices from Lord’s in London—home of the MCC, the game’s original rulers
                  and still its lawmakers—to Dubai, the shift away from the old ways of governance was complete. The
                  priorities of the game changed too. By the turn of the 21st century, only Australia and England still
                  played Test cricket to full houses. Everywhere else, and particularly in India and Pakistan, crowds
                  flocked to see limited-overs internationals. Test cricket became almost an afterthought. Although the
                  power to change the laws of the game have remained with the MCC, the ICC developed its own Code of
                  Conduct for players, officials, and administrators, which sets out disciplinary procedures and
                  protects the spirit of the game. It also organized major international tournaments, including the
                  one-day and Twenty20 World Cups and the Champions Trophy. In 2000 the ICC set up the Anti-Corruption
                  Unit (renamed the Anti-Corruption Unit and Security Unit in 2003) to combat the growing threat of
                  illegal gambling and match fixing. At the beginning of the 2010s, the ICC had 10 full members and
                  dozens of associate and affiliate members. <br> <br>
