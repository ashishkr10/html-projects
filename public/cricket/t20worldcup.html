     <div class="level2">
          <p> <strong> Twenty20 cricket </strong>, also called T20, truncated form of cricket that revolutionized the
               game when it was introduced in 2003 with rule changes that put a premium on hitting and scoring, gaining
               a new audience for cricket. <br> <br>
               The basic rules are the same as for the longer versions, but innings are limited to 20 overs a side (an
               over comprises six balls delivered, or thrown, by a bowler to a batsman at the opposite wicket), with a
               maximum of four overs for each bowler and restrictions on the placement of fielders designed to encourage
               big hitting by the batsmen and high scores. In a short time, T20 became the most popular and lucrative
               form of cricket, particularly in India, where huge crowds attend matches in the Indian Premier League
               (IPL) and millions more watch on television. A shortened form of cricket known as Cricket Max was
               developed in New Zealand in the 1990s by the former Test batsman Martin Crowe, but the official rules for
               T20 were established by the England and Wales Cricket Board, and the first tournament was played by the
               English county teams, in 2003. <br> <br>
               The format was quickly adopted by other countries, and two years later Australia and New Zealand played
               each other in a lighthearted T20 match in Auckland, the first official international T20 match. Both
               sides wore uniforms from the 1980s and wore (mostly fake) moustaches. It quickly became apparent, though,
               that T20 had the potential to attract a new, vibrant, young audience to cricket. The first T20 World Cup,
               played in South Africa in 2007, was won by India, creating a huge market for T20 on the subcontinent that
               was quickly exploited by the IPL. Subsequent World Cups were played in England in 2009 (won by Pakistan)
               and in the West Indies in 2010 (won by England). Each major cricketing country developed its own domestic
               T20 tournaments, and a Champions League competition between the best club sides—like that contested in
               European football (soccer)—is held at the end of each T20 season. <br> <br>
               With its cheerleaders, loud music, and quick-fire entertainment, T20 was credited with reviving cricket
               in the 21st century. After initial doubts, players began to master the new skills demanded by T20 and to
               improve their fielding, throwing, and fitness. Traditional cricket followers, however, feared that
               inevitably T20 would threaten the future of Test cricket, regarded as the purest and most intricate form
               of the game. <br> <br>
