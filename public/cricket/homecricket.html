                  <strong>Cricket</strong>, England’s national summer sport, which is now played throughout the world,
                  particularly in Australia, India, Pakistan, the West Indies, and the British Isles. <br> <br>
                  Cricket is played with a bat and ball and involves two competing sides (teams) of 11 players. The
                  field is oval with a rectangular area in the middle, known as the pitch, that is 22 yards (20.12
                  metres) by 10 feet (3.04 metres) wide. Two sets of three sticks, called wickets, are set in the ground
                  at each end of the pitch. Across the top of each wicket lie horizontal pieces called bails. The sides
                  take turns at batting and bowling (pitching); each turn is called an “innings” (always plural). Sides
                  have one or two innings each, depending on the prearranged duration of the match, the object being to
                  score the most runs. The bowlers, delivering the ball with a straight arm, try to break (hit) the
                  wicket with the ball so that the bails fall. This is one of several ways that the batsman is
                  dismissed, or put out. A bowler delivers six balls at one wicket (thus completing an “over”), then a
                  different player from his side bowls six balls to the opposite wicket. The batting side defends its
                  wicket. <br> <br>
                  There are two batsman up at a time, and the batsman being bowled to (the striker) tries to hit the
                  ball away from the wicket. A hit may be defensive or offensive. A defensive hit may protect the wicket
                  but leave the batsmen no time to run to the opposite wicket. In that case the batsmen need not run,
                  and play will resume with another bowl. If the batsman can make an offensive hit, he and the second
                  batsman (the nonstriker) at the other wicket change places. Each time both batsmen can reach the
                  opposite wicket, one run is scored. Providing they have enough time without being caught out and
                  dismissed, the batsmen may continue to cross back and forth between the wickets, earning an additional
                  run for each time both reach the opposite side. There is an outside boundary around the cricket field.
                  A ball hit to or beyond the boundary scores four points if it hits the ground and then reaches the
                  boundary, six points if it reaches the boundary from the air (a fly ball). The team with the highest
                  number of runs wins a match. Should both teams be unable to complete their number of innings before
                  the time allotted, the match is declared a draw. Scores in the hundreds are common in cricket. <br>
                  <br>
                  Matches in cricket can range from informal weekend afternoon encounters on village greens to top-level
                  international contests spread over five days in Test matches and played by leading professional
                  players in grand stadiums. <br> <br>

                  Cricket grounds vary in size from great arenas, such as the main playing area at Lord’s in London (5.5
                  acres [2.2 hectares]) and the even larger Melbourne Cricket Ground, to village greens and small
                  meadows. Level turf of fine texture is the ideal surface, but where this is unavailable any artificial
                  covered surface—such as coir (fibre) matting or artificial turf on a firm base—may be used. The limits
                  of the playing area are usually marked by a boundary line or fence. <br> <br>
                  A wicket consists of three stumps, or stakes, each 28 inches (71.1 cm) high and of equal thickness
                  (about 1.25 inches in diameter), stuck into the ground and so spaced that the ball cannot pass between
                  them. Two pieces of wood called bails, each 4.37 inches (11.1 cm) long, lie in grooves on the tops of
                  the stumps. The bails do not extend beyond the stumps and do not project more than half an inch above
                  them. The whole wicket is 9 inches (22.86 cm) in width. There are two of these wickets, which a
                  batsman defends and a bowler attacks, and they are approximately in the centre of the ground, facing
                  one another at each end of the pitch. <br> <br>
                  Lines of whitewash demarcate the creases at each wicket: the bowling crease is a line drawn through
                  the base of the stumps and extending 4.33 feet (1.32 metres) on either side of the centre stump; the
                  return crease is a line at each end of and at right angles to the bowling crease, extending behind the
                  wicket; and the popping crease is a line parallel with the bowling crease and 4 feet in front of it.
                  The bowling and return creases mark the area within which the bowler’s rear foot must be grounded in
                  delivering the ball; the popping crease, which is 62 feet (18.9 metres) from the opposing bowling
                  crease, demarks the batsman’s ground. When a batsman is running between wickets, the crease represents
                  the area in which he is “safe” (in baseball parlance) and only a cricketer’s bat need be in the
                  crease; thus a batsman will often place just the tip of the bat over the line of the crease and then
                  begin to run for the opposite wicket. <br> <br>
                  The blade of the paddle-shaped bat is made of willow and must not be broader than 4.25 inches (10.8
                  cm). The length of the bat, including the handle, must not exceed 38 inches (96.5 cm). The ball, which
                  has a core of cork built up with string, was traditionally encased in polished red leather, although
                  white is now frequently used, especially for night games. The halves of the ball are sewn together
                  with a raised seam (the seam being like the equator on a globe, not like the curved seam of a baseball
                  or tennis ball). Slightly smaller, harder, and heavier than a baseball, it must weigh between 5.5 and
                  5.75 ounces (156 and 163 grams) and measure between 8.8 and 9 inches (22.4 and 22.9 cm) in
                  circumference. In the early days of cricket it was common to use the same ball for an entire match,
                  which allowed for pitches with more swerve and movement as the match wore on. Even today a cricket
                  ball may stay in play for an entire day of a match, and, as the ball gets more used, it is
                  progressively more difficult to hit. <br> <br>
                  Cricket attire has evolved with men’s fashion. In the 18th century cricketers wore tricorne hats, knee
                  breeches, silk stockings, and shoes with buckles. More colourful dress was common on the field in the
                  18th century, and only in the late 19th century did the uniform long associated with cricket arrive:
                  white flannel trousers with a white shirt and V-necked sweater, the sweater often trimmed with club
                  colours. Players have worn a myriad of hat styles, including top hats and straw hats, but in the 1880s
                  the coloured cap became the norm. White buckskin shoes also became popular for men in the 1880s, and
                  cricketers then adopted the white shoes (known, however, as boots) that are traditionally worn with
                  flannels. In a break with tradition, late 20th-century players began to wear brightly coloured
                  clothing to differentiate between teams on the grounds. By the 21st century the predominant outfit for
                  cricket was a loose-fitting polo shirt (either short- or long-sleeved) with matching trousers and
                  spiked cleats for traction. <br> <br>
                  With the advent of fast bowling, cricketers adopted protective dress. The batsman wears white pads
                  (leg guards), an abdominal protector, and batting gloves to protect the fingers; batsmen may also wear
                  helmets and other protection. The wicketkeeper also wears pads and reinforced gauntlets (the other
                  fielders do not wear gloves). <br> <br>

                  One player on each team acts as captain. There are two umpires—one standing behind the bowler’s
                  wicket, the other at the position called square leg about 15 yards from the batsman’s popping crease
                  (see the figure)—to control the game according to the laws; two scorers record its progress. The
                  object of the game is for one side to score more runs than the other. <br> <br>
                  At the start of a match, the captain who wins the toss of a coin decides whether his own or the other
                  side shall take first innings—i.e., proceed successively as batsmen, the first two as a pair together,
                  to the wicket and try to make as many runs as possible against the bowling and fielding of their
                  opponents. There are three methods by which an innings is completed: (1) when 10 batsmen have been
                  dismissed (the remaining batsman, having no partner, is declared “not out”); (2) when the captain of
                  the batting side declares his innings closed before all 10 men are out (a captain may decide to
                  declare if his team has a large lead in runs and he fears that the innings will continue so long that
                  the opposing team will not have time to get in their full innings and the game will therefore be a
                  draw); or (3) in a match of one innings a side, when the allotted number of overs expires. Results are
                  recorded by the margin of runs or, if the side batting last passes the other side’s total before all
                  their batsmen have been dismissed, by the number of their wickets (i.e., batsmen still to be
                  dismissed) outstanding. <br> <br>
                  Matches are decided either by the number of runs scored in one innings each (usually for one-day
                  matches) or on the aggregate of runs made by each side in two innings. Test matches last five days (30
                  playing hours), other first-class matches from three to four days, and the bulk of club, school, and
                  village matches one day. <br> <br>
                  The nonbatting side takes up positions in the field. One man is the bowler (similar to the pitcher in
                  baseball), another is the wicketkeeper (similar to the catcher), and the remaining nine are positioned
                  as the captain or the bowler directs (see the figure). The first batsman (the striker) guards his
                  wicket by standing with at least one foot behind the popping crease. His partner (the nonstriker)
                  waits behind the popping crease at the bowler’s end. The bowler tries to hit the batsman’s wicket or
                  to dismiss him in other ways. <br> <br>
